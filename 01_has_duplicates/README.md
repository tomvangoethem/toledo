In this folder, you find five different versions of an algorithm that checks whether a list contains duplicates.
Analyze their time complexity for both the best and worst cases, and perform measurements to check your answer.

Also, compare the worst cases of version 1 and 2; what do you expect? Do your measurements confirm this?
